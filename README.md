# SK-ActiveLearning 
These code is for paper "Uncertainty Quantification and Optimal Robust Design for Machining Operations"
The "True boundary approximated byTFEM and estimated boundary by SK-active learning.ipynb" is the python code in jupyt notebook about how to achieve the aproximated stability boundary by TFEM and how to predict the stablility boundary by SK-active learning.
The "Import the achieved data and Reliable analysis to get optimal MRR.ipynb" is the python code in jupyt notebook to achieved the optimal MRR based on the data achieved from SK-active learning.
The data folder contains all the neccessary data achieved from "True boundary approximated byTFEM and estimated boundary by SK-active learning.ipynb" code.
